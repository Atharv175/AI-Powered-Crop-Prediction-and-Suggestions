# AI-Powered-Crop-Prediction-and-Suggestions
This project is an AI-powered crop prediction tool designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to plant based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. 
This project aims to provide accurate crop recommendations based on various environmental parameters and soil conditions. Additionally, it introduces the concept of the Weather Stress Index (WSI) to assess the potential stress on crops due to weather conditions.
Features:
Multiple Machine Learning Models: The system employs several machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict the most suitable crop for given soil and environmental conditions.
Model Evaluation: Cross-validation and performance metrics are used to evaluate each model, ensuring the most accurate predictions.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search is used to optimize the Random Forest model, further enhancing its predictive power.
Weather Stress Index (WSI): A unique feature that evaluates the potential stress on crops due to weather conditions, helping farmers make informed decisions.
User Input Interface: An easy-to-use interface for inputting soil and environmental data to get crop recommendations.
